This is a fun project that I am doing to practice API calls and extracting that data to store it into an SQL Database. 
It is also a project to practice making searches within a database based on conditions and to display it.

This project is entirely coded in Python, and uses pyodbc and requests library.
To install those dependecies:
pip install pyodbc
pip install requests

To run this program, you must have a functional SQL Server Connection, and I recommend using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
